# MyMultiToken - ERC1155 Token Contract

MyMultiToken is an implementation of the ERC1155 standard for multi-token contracts. It allows for the creation, management, and transfer of multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract.

## Contract Details

- **Name:** MyMultiToken
- **Standard:** ERC1155
- 
## Features

MyMultiToken includes the following features:

- Minting of single or multiple tokens.
- Burning of single or multiple tokens.
- Safe transfer and batch transfer of tokens.
- Approval management for safe transfers.
- ERC165 interface for compatibility checks.
- ERC1155 Metadata URI support for providing metadata for tokens.

## Getting Started

To use MyMultiToken in your Solidity project, you can import and deploy it. Here's an example of how to do so:

// Import the MyMultiToken contract
import "./MyMultiToken.sol";

// Deploy the contract
MyMultiToken myToken = new MyMultiToken();


## Usage

### Minting Tokens

You can mint single or multiple tokens using the `mint` and `batchMint` functions:

```solidity
myToken.mint(tokenId, amount, data);
myToken.batchMint(ids, values, data);
```

### Burning Tokens

Burning tokens is done using the `burn` and `batchBurn` functions:

```solidity
myToken.burn(tokenId, amount);
myToken.batchBurn(ids, values);
```

### Transferring Tokens

To transfer tokens, use the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions. Ensure that you have approval from the owner to transfer their tokens:

```solidity
myToken.safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, amount, data);
myToken.safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, values, data);
```

### Approval Management

You can manage approvals for token transfers using the `setApprovalForAll` function:

```solidity
myToken.setApprovalForAll(operator, approved);
```

### Metadata URI

You can implement the `uri` function in your derived contract to provide metadata URIs for tokens.

```solidity
function uri(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string memory) {
    return "https://example.com/api/token/{id}";
}
```

## ERC1155 Standard

MyMultiToken complies with the ERC1155 standard as specified in the [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) Ethereum Improvement Proposal.
